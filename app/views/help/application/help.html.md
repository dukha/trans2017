<%=raw(render :partial => $APPLICATION_HELP_VIEW_DIR + "shared/horizontal_menu") %>
###Introduction
> Translator is meant to help you translate a software application into your own language by accessing the programmers codes and the English translation. The English translation has been added by the programmers as well.

> Translator works with 2 databases. When a translator makes a translation then the translation is written to a traditional (relational)database. 

> When the translation is finished then it can be published to an in-memory database, called __Redis__. Normally publication is done by and administrator.

> A developer inserts translation_codes into the application and then provides a translation for each code. The developer can add translations directly to the (relational) database or add them to a file in yaml format which can then be uploaded to the database.

> An adminstrator normally would create new applications in the database, new application versions and add translation languages. 
> An administrator also would do uploads of yaml files and publish completed translations

> As you can see Translator has 3 types of users

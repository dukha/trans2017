#####Introduction
A single translation consists of the following information

* An application version language
  - For example _Calm version 4 German_
* A code (called Dot Key Code in Translator because it is in a form separarated by dots)
    -  e.g. _activerecord.models.course.location_
  - It is the key to this translation in all languages
* The translation itself
